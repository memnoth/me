      <description>Have you ever experienced such horrible signaling between core processes which might crash a whole system. This article is about an approach let you be safe from enermies. It&amp;rsquo;d be good for both linux distros we mainly use in laptops and embedded systems. but more comfy on the latter for a test.
Someone says &amp;ldquo;Better safe than sorry&amp;rdquo;. I like that quote. Even though software world is totally chaotic on bugs, we should at least try some approaches being safe.</description>

I thought that it might be by the use of the pinky a lot, so that looked for a solution in Google. Firstly, I could have modified my input method program a bit such that swap between Ctrl and Caps Lock, but felt frustrated all the steps code level to testing.</description>
