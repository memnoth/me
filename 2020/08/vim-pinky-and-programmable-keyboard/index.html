        <h1>Vim Pinky and Programmable Keyboard</h1><time>August 29, 2020</time></header><p>I use my left pinky to jump back and forth in vim with cscope, ctags + vim comb a lot everyday. Especially <code>ctrl + t, o, ]</code> and so on. However, it has been hurt slightly. I thought that it might be by the use of the pinky a lot, so that looked for a solution in Google. Firstly, I could have modified my input method program a bit such that swap between <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Caps Lock</code>, but felt frustrated all the steps code level to testing. At a random period of time looking for solutions, I just looked down, see my keyboard and found out there was a key saying &ldquo;<strong>Switch layer</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I said &ldquo;Yeh, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ok, let me say this, not all keyboards existed support this functionality. You should check it out first.</p>

<p>I am currently using <strong>Vortex Race 3</strong> and it has it. It supports 4 switch layers and be able to customize user keymap in each one. So I swapped these two keys, <code>Caps Lock</code> and <code>Ctrl</code>. Yet I am still trying to get used to the new map, my pinky get better. :-)</p>
