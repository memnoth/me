      <description>Have you ever experienced such horrible signaling between core processes which might crash a whole system. This article is about an approach let you be safe from enermies. It&amp;rsquo;d be good for both linux distros we mainly use in laptops and embedded systems. but more comfy on the latter for a test.

Firstly, I could have modified my input method program a bit such that swap between Ctrl and Caps Lock, but felt frustrated all the steps code level to testing.</description>
